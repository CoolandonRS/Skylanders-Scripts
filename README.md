# Skylanders-Scripts
Scripts for a proxmark3 running [iceman](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3) to easily dump and modify the contents of skylanders.

Couldn't find alot of resources for doing this with a proxmark[^1] so I started working on it myself. More features might be slowly added.

[^1]: All resources I could find seem to use an ACR122U. I think this originally came from [one of the most comprehensive docs](https://marijnkneppers.dev/posts/reverse-engineering-skylanders-toys-to-life-mechanics/) using the ACR122U, and as such there is literally no advantage for using it over a proxmark.
